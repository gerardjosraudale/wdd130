  <h2>Josue Raudales</h2>
  <p>Hello everyone, I am Josue and I am from Honduras my wife is from Minnesota. We have a corgi dog (Max) and we have a baby girl on the way in February. I like camping, working out, listening to music, spending time with family, trying new food, have a good meal. We leave in Rexburg Idaho, and my major is Software Engineering. Something that I like to eat is a medium rare steak with mashed potatoes, gravy, and a nice Cesar salad.  A special skill that I have is making music with DAW'S. The thing that I love the most about BYU-Idaho is the campus. It's something being on campus that I can not explain.</p>
  <p>The advantages that I see from learning about careers in information technology are that I can help others with my skills and make things easier around us. I am taking this course because it's required, but I like to learn more about web fundamentals. I am hoping to get out of this course to learn more about web development and understand more about the types of languages to build a website. I will use this course in my personal life to create a programs/websites to make things easy. </p>
  <p>I have been member of the Church my whole life, my dad get to know the chruch when he was a kind and the same with my mom. My favorite scripture is 1 Nephi 3:7, it's a classic one lol. I am exited to be here in this class with all of you. </p>
